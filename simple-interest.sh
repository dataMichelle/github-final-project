Simple Interest Calculation:

Simple Interest Equation (Principal + Interest)
A = P(1 + rt)

Where:

A = Total Accrued Amount (principal + interest)
P = Principal Amount
I = Interest Amount
r = Rate of Interest per year in decimal; r = R/100
R = Rate of Interest per year as a percent; R = r * 100
t = Time Period involved in months or years
From the base formula, A = P(1 + rt) derived from A = P + I and since I = Prt then A = P + I becomes A = P + Prt which can be rewritten as A = P(1 + rt)
